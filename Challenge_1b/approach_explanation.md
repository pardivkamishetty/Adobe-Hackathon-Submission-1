# Approach Explanation: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Methodology Overview

Our solution implements a persona-driven document intelligence system using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity** for content relevance ranking. The approach is designed to be generic and scalable across diverse document domains, personas, and tasks.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Uses `pdfplumber` to extract text content from PDFs while preserving document structure and page information
- **Content Segmentation**: Breaks documents into meaningful sections by identifying text lines that start with uppercase letters and meet minimum length criteria
- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintains document name, page number, and section title for traceability

### 2. Relevance Scoring Algorithm
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts persona descriptions, job-to-be-done tasks, and document sections into numerical vectors using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures semantic similarity between user queries (persona + task) and document sections
- **Ranking System**: Sorts sections by relevance scores to prioritize most pertinent content

### 3. Output Generation
- **Structured JSON**: Produces standardized output containing metadata, top-ranked sections, and refined text analysis
- **Importance Ranking**: Assigns numerical ranks to extracted sections based on relevance scores
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Includes processing timestamp for audit and versioning purposes

## Technical Implementation

The solution uses CPU-only processing with lightweight libraries (scikit-learn, pdfplumber) ensuring fast execution under 60 seconds. The generic design handles diverse document types (research papers, business reports, educational content) and various personas (researchers, analysts, students) without domain-specific modifications.

## Scalability and Robustness

The system automatically handles missing dependencies through dynamic installation and provides comprehensive error handling for various edge cases including missing files, corrupted PDFs, and empty content scenarios.
