# Adobe India Hackathon 2025

## My Submission for the "Connecting the Dots" Challenge

### Rethinking Reading. Rediscovering Knowledge.

What if PDFs could do more than just display content?  
What if they could *understand*, *connect*, and *guide* us through the information they hold?

That’s the vision I pursued in the **Connecting the Dots Challenge** — transforming the passive PDF into an intelligent, interactive experience that surfaces structure, insights, and meaning across entire document collections.

## 🧠 The Journey & What I Built

### 🏁 Round 1.1 — Brains Behind the PDF

I started by developing a fast and accurate PDF outline extractor that doesn't just rely on fonts — it *understands* layout, structure, and intent. Using a multi-factor confidence system, I identified headings, assigned hierarchy levels, and produced structured outputs that are schema-compliant and robust.

### 🎯 Round 1.2 — Contextual PDF Exploration

Building on the foundation from Round 1, I extended the work to support **multi-document analysis**. I created a solution that takes in diverse PDF collections, considers personas and specific tasks, and extracts the most relevant content. From travel planning to recipe extraction, the system adapts to the user’s goals and delivers context-rich insights.

## 🔍 Why This Matters to Me

In a world overwhelmed by documents, it’s not about accessing more information — it’s about understanding it faster and better.  
This project let me blend engineering with empathy — designing a system that reads between the lines and makes learning more intuitive.

Whether you're a developer, a researcher, or just a curious mind — this solution is built to help you **connect the dots**.

Thanks to Adobe for hosting a hackathon that truly encouraged us to think differently about documents.  
This was about more than parsing PDFs — it was about making them come alive.

Let’s keep building.
